- Prefer polars over pandas for data analysis with python.
- Use python data types everywhere possible.
- Functions/classes always should have Numpy docstrings standard.
- Make sure the code can handle all the exceptions.
- For python class always use it with the dataclasses module.
- Always use the pathlib module to represent filesystem paths.
